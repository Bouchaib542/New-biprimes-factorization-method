# Biprime Factorization Tool

This is a public tool created by **Bahbouhi Bouchaib** and **ChatGPT** to factorize biprime numbers (numbers of the form _p × q_ where _p_ and _q_ are prime).

The site allows users to input a large integer and uses a refined algorithm to test whether it is a biprime and recover its two prime factors efficiently.

## Features

- Accepts very large integers (tested successfully up to ~10²²).
- Recovers the prime factors if they exist and are both primes.
- Works in any modern browser using JavaScript + BigInt.

## Authors

- **Bahbouhi Bouchaib** (Independent researcher, Nantes, France)
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI collaborator)

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML page in your browser.
2. Enter an odd number (suspected to be a biprime).
3. Click on "Factorize".
4. The tool will return the prime factors if it is indeed a biprime.
